# missing check to see if the L2 sequencer is down

## Summary
When working with chainlink in L2's its important to remember the centralization risk of the sequencer.
## Vulnerability Detail
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.

If the sequencer is down, messages cannot be transmitted from L1 to L2, and no L2 transactions are executed.
```solidity
    function _getOraclePriceUSD(
        AggregatorV3Interface feed,
        uint32 maxOracleUpdateDuration
    ) internal view returns (uint256 oraclePriceUSD) {
        (, int256 oraclePriceUSDInt, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = feed.latestRoundData();


        if (block.timestamp - updatedAt > maxOracleUpdateDuration) {
            revert HOTOracle___getOraclePriceUSD_stalePrice();
        }


        oraclePriceUSD = oraclePriceUSDInt.toUint256();
    }
```
## Impact
If a sequencer becomes unavailable, it is impossible to access read/write APIs that consumers are using and applications on the L2 network will be down for most users without interacting directly through the L1 optimistic rollup contracts.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _getOraclePriceUSD(
        AggregatorV3Interface feed,
        uint32 maxOracleUpdateDuration
    ) internal view returns (uint256 oraclePriceUSD) {
        (, int256 oraclePriceUSDInt, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = feed.latestRoundData();


        if (block.timestamp - updatedAt > maxOracleUpdateDuration) {
            revert HOTOracle___getOraclePriceUSD_stalePrice();
        }


        oraclePriceUSD = oraclePriceUSDInt.toUint256();
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommendation is to implement a check for the sequencer in the L2 version of the contract, and a code example of Chainlink can be found at https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code.
