# ArrakisStandardManager::rebalance Malicious executor can bypass slippage check and steal funds from a public vault

## Summary

A malicious executor can bypass the reserves checks at the end of `ArrakisStandardManager::rebalance`, by using a malicious contract as `_router` during a `ValantisModule::swap` call and using it to deposit through `ArrakisPublicVaultRouter::addLiquidity`. This would increase reserves temporarily in order to pass the checks, but the added funds can be withdrawn by the executor after `rebalance` is done.

## Vulnerability Detail

### Checks preventing funds extraction by executor

There are two levels of checks to bypass in order to accomplish the full attack:

1/ Slippage checks in `ValantisModule::swap` limit slippage for a given swap operated by the `router` to a reasonable value (let's assume 1%):

- check `expectedMinReturn`: [ValantisHOTModule.sol#L335-L342](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/main/arrakis-modular/src/abstracts/ValantisHOTModule.sol#L335-L342)

- and then:
[ValantisHOTModule.sol#L384-L397](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/main/arrakis-modular/src/abstracts/ValantisHOTModule.sol#L384-L397)


2/ Reserves held by the pool are checked at the end of rebalance:
[ArrakisStandardManager.sol#L391-L414](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/main/arrakis-modular/src/ArrakisStandardManager.sol#L391-L414)


### Bypassing the checks

Let's see how to bypass these checks:

1/ Since we are allowed an unlimited number of arbitrary calls to the module during `rebalance`, we can use many `swap`s each incurring an allowed 1% slippage (which is going to the attacker).
This means that for 50 swaps approx 40% of the TVL of the vault is out:
[ArrakisStandardManager.sol#L364-L379](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/main/arrakis-modular/src/ArrakisStandardManager.sol#L364-L379)

> Alternatively one could manipulate the pool to incur slippage on the `depositLiquidity` call in `swap`, since the slippage controls are controlled by the `executor`:
[ValantisHOTModule.sol#L406-L411](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/main/arrakis-modular/src/abstracts/ValantisHOTModule.sol#L406-L411)


2/ Now that an arbitrary amount of funds is extracted from the pool, we need to use one last call on the module, in order to `addLiquidity` via the `ArrakisPublicVaultRouter` and inflate reserves. 

To do so, we execute a `ValantisModule::swap`, with `amountIn` being zero, and use an attacker provided contract as `router` to call on `ArrakisPublicVaultRouter::addLiquidity`.

The deposited funds will increase the reserves back to their initial values, except the executor can withdraw these funds after rebalance is done.


## Impact

Theft of arbitrary amount of funds from public vaults by a malicious executor

## Scenario

1. The malicious executor calls `ArrakisStandardManager::rebalance` with a crafted `payloads_` that includes:
- 50 calls to `module::swap` with an attacker controlled `routerA`, each keeping 1% of `amountIn` and sending `tokenOut`
- 1 call to `module::swap` with attacker controlled `routerB`, which calls on `ArrakisPublicVaultRouter::addLiquidity` and deposits the missing liquidity back, but claimable by the attacker

2. The malicious executor calls `ArrakisPublicVaultRouter::removeLiquidity`, and withdraws 40% of the available reserves in the router

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1/ Instead of checking available reserves at the end of `ArrakisStandardManager::rebalance`, please consider checking the share price `reserves/totalSupply`

> a private vault does not implement ERC20 and does not keep accounting of shares, so a virtual arbitrary share value such as `1e18` can be used.
> This is safe because it is considered that only the private vault owner can deposit into a private vault, so this means that the executor should not be able to do step 2. above.

2/ Additionally, one can add deviation checks on slippage controls provided by the executor here:
[ValantisHOTModule.sol#L406-L411](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/main/arrakis-modular/src/abstracts/ValantisHOTModule.sol#L406-L411)

3/ Finally, add a whitelist of approved routers for handling swaps in modules.
