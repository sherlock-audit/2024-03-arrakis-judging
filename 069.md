# Insufficient swap price validation means that solvers can their use signed quotes as free options, causing losses to the LP

## Summary

Under conditions where only the first HOT swap in a block gets a discount, there's little incentive to submit the remaining signed quotes for inclusion immediately. Instead, rational solvers can be expected to delay as long as possible, and exercise their free "option" only when it's profitable to them, causing systemic losses to the LP.  The losses can be quite big even for a single swap, as the price a non-discounted HOT swap is executed is not directly validated against the current price of the AMM.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol is designed to support multiple active HOT quotes, as evidenced by the fact the "non-discounted HOT swap" concept exists. Depending on the order the quotes land on the chain, the first is expected to be performed as a discounted swap, the others as non-discounted HOT swaps. For discounted swaps, the execution price can be "better" than the fair price of the asset, by design. In return, these swaps perform AMMs price synchronization with external venues, as a service. Sponsor's comment from Discord:
> we need solvers in HOT for landing flashswap on chain, flashswap has market datas to change liquidity and amm price to the market price. [..] In exchange of this service, they will get a deterministic competitive fixed price for doing a swap

Non-discounted swaps do not perform this service, and therefore should be executed at a worse price, at or close to the fair trading price. 

Discounted swaps are expected to be included as soon as possible, as long as there's at least two competing solvers, because delaying them let's the other solver to be first and get the profit from the swap. However, once solver has got frontrun by another solver, they have little incentive to include their non-discounted HOT swap immediately. (It's possible to detect such a frontrun by e.g. enclosing the swap in a transaction that checks the `amountOut` and reverts if the discount was not applied - using private RPCs normally ensures that reverting transactions are not included in blocks.) Instead, a profitable strategy for the solver is to wait as long as possible, and only include the HOT swap if has a good price relative to the market price at the end of the waiting period.

The signed quote that the solver has essentially becomes a free option, given out by the protocol at no cost. The default expiry time for quotes can be quite long, with `maxDelay` expected to be set to 10 min (according to the docs) or 20 min (value in the deployment script). The asset's price can easily change by several % during these minutes. The solver can wait for `expiry - epsilon` seconds (where `epsilon` is a small number, depending on the chain's block time), and check the new asset's price on a CEX, and make a non-atomic arbitrage between the CEX and the Valantis pool.

Even if the `expiry` is set to a very small value by the signer, it cannot fully prevent the problem, although it does reduce it greatly! Even expiry time of zero is still theoretically arbitrageable on some L2s, including Arbitrum, that can have multiple blocks per second. On Arbitrum a block is generated whenever there are outstanding transactions, with min 250 ms interval. As result, the unfilled quote is still a free option, albeit with expiry time of less than a second. Delaying the choice whether to submit the quote is still expected to give some profit at the expense of the LP if the CEX price rapidly moves in one direction.

The signer can detect this behavior and blacklist such a solver. However, it may not easy to do so, as the solvers can pretend to have honest delays due to some setup issues, and/or perform this attack only occasionally.

Notably, the execution price of the HOT swap is not validated against the current AMM price in the `validatePriceConsistency` function, enabling quotes that have significantly worse price than the current AMM price to be executed, even if they are not classified as discounted.

## Impact

The LP is going to suffer systemic losses if multiple solvers are permitted to get signed quotes at the same time.
(If only one solver is permitted to get a signed quote at a time, the system is not going to be competitive.)

In a HOT swap, `hot.sqrtSpotPriceX96New` is always used as argument for `validatePriceConsistency` even though it's only applied if `isDiscountedHot` is true:
```solidity
    function _hotSwap(
        ALMLiquidityQuoteInput memory almLiquidityQuoteInput,
        bytes memory externalContext,
        ALMLiquidityQuote memory liquidityQuote
    ) internal {
        // ...
        HOTParams.validatePriceConsistency(
            _ammState,
            sqrtHotPriceX96,
            hot.sqrtSpotPriceX96New,  // @audit
            getSqrtOraclePriceX96(),
            hotReadSlot.maxOracleDeviationBipsLower,
            hotReadSlot.maxOracleDeviationBipsUpper,
            _hotMaxDiscountBipsLower,
            _hotMaxDiscountBipsUpper
        );
        // ...
        // Only update the pool state, if this is a discounted hot quote
        if (isDiscountedHot) {
            // ...
            // Update AMM sqrt spot price
            _ammState.setSqrtSpotPriceX96(hot.sqrtSpotPriceX96New);
        }
    }
```
## PoC

Let's say that at timestamp `T`, the "true" price of the asset is P, and the AMM's price is 0.98*P. The signer may issue multiple quotes with that timestamp, Q1 and Q2, to two competing solvers S1 and S2:

```text
Q1.sqrtHotPriceX96Discounted = 0.99*P
Q1.sqrtHotPriceX96Base       = 0.995*P
Q1.sqrtSpotPriceX96New       = P
Q1.nonce                     = 1
Q1.signatureTimestamp        = T
Q1.expiry                    = 60

Q2.sqrtHotPriceX96Discounted = 0.99*P
Q2.sqrtHotPriceX96Base       = 0.995*P
Q2.sqrtSpotPriceX96New       = P
Q2.nonce                     = 2
Q2.signatureTimestamp        = T
Q2.expiry                    = 60
```
The intention is that both quotes can be executed, so their nonces are different. Let's assume that in the block with timestamp T, a swap with the quote Q1 gets included, as a discounted swap, with execution price 0.99 P, and after-swap price of P.

S2 has the initiative to delay the execution of Q2. S2 waits for 60 - 12 seconds, and checks CEX price of the asset. Let's assume that its 1.05 P.

S2 now submits their swap with Q2 for inclusion. The prices are validated in `validatePriceConsistency` function.

First `sqrtHotPriceX96Base` is compared with `sqrtSpotPriceNewX96`. This obviously passes (because we know that Q1 was valid, and the price difference is smaller for Q2).

Then the AMM price `sqrtSpotPriceX96` is compared with `sqrtOraclePriceX96`. Let's say the oracle is lagging slightly, at 1.03 P, but the `maxOracleDeviationBipsUpper` is set such that the check passes (e.g. to 200).

Then `sqrtSpotPriceNewX96` (P) is compared with `sqrtOraclePriceX96` (1.03 P). Let's say again the `maxOracleDeviationBipsLower` is set such that the check passes (e.g. to 300).

As a result, the swap is considered valid, even though the AMM price is almost 6% higher than the HOT execution price (1.05 P vs. 0.995 P).

Nowhere in the process is the execution price is directly compared with either the oracle price, or the current AMM price.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

* directly validate the execution price of non-discounted HOT swaps against the current AMM price, to prohibit execution at significantly worse prices
* carefully choose appropriate values for the `expiry` argument
* consider adding a mechanism that lets the signer to invalidate all previously issues signed quotes
