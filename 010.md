# Incorrect Access Control in `setMaxOracleDeviationBips` Function

## Summary
The `setMaxOracleDeviationBips` function in the contract is intended to set the maximum allowed deviation between AMM and oracle price. However, the function is currently protected by the `onlyManager` modifier instead of the `onlyLiquidityProvider` modifier, as suggested by the comments. This incorrect access control allows unauthorized entities to call the function, potentially leading to incorrect settings and manipulation of the oracle deviation bounds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function is intended to be callable only by the `liquidityProvider` as indicated by the comments. However, it is currently protected by the `onlyManager` modifier. This misalignment in access control can lead to unauthorized access, allowing entities other than the liquidityProvider to modify critical parameters, potentially leading to incorrect oracle deviation settings.
## Impact
Unauthorized Access: The function can be called by any entity with `onlyManager` privileges, rather than being restricted to the `liquidityProvider`.
Incorrect Settings: Unauthorized changes to the oracle deviation bounds can result in incorrect price deviations being used, potentially leading to financial discrepancies and market manipulation.
Security Risk: Incorrect access control can expose the contract to security risks, allowing unauthorized entities to manipulate critical parameters.

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, replace the `onlyManager` modifier with the `onlyLiquidityProvider` modifier to ensure that only the liquidityProvider can call this function. This aligns with the intended access control specified in the comments and documentation.
