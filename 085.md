# Caller Verification in removeLiquidity Function

## Summary
The removeLiquidity and removeLiquidityPermit2 function in the smart contract is responsible for removing liquidity from a vault and burning LP tokens. There is a potential security issue where the function does not check if the caller (msg.sender) is the same as the receiver (params_.receiver). This oversight could allow unauthorized parties to remove someone else's liquidity.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function currently does not validate that the caller (msg.sender) is the same as the params_.receiver. This lack of validation means that any user could potentially call this function and specify another user's address as the receiver, leading to unauthorized liquidity removal.

## Impact
Without verifying that the caller is the intended receiver, an attacker could remove another user's liquidity, leading to potential loss of assets for the affected user.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a check to ensure that the caller (msg.sender) is the same as the params_.receiver. This can be done by adding a simple conditional check before proceeding with the liquidity removal.
