# The attacker can steal funds from the pool.

## Summary

The attacker uses rounding up to obtain 1 share for the amount of 1 token.

## Vulnerability Detail

The attacker uses `ArrakisMetaVaultPublic.mint` for deposits, acquiring only 1 share each time. Due to rounding up, the calculated proportion value also becomes 1. In `ValantisHOTModulePublic.deposit`, rounding up occurs as well. Therefore, when the numerator is less than the denominator, the calculation shows that a user only needs to deposit 1 token to obtain 1 share.

If a user deposits through `ArrakisPublicVaultRouter`, the calculation in `ValantisHOTModulePublic.deposit` for the deposit amount is correct. However, when users use `ArrakisMetaVaultPublic.mint`, the tokens are not converted into equivalent decimals. For tokens with lower decimals, the calculation remains 0, but due to rounding up, it is calculated as 1.

As the fees collected increase, shares become more valuable. However, attackers can exploit this method to acquire shares at a lower cost.

Ultimately, large amounts of shares are obtained through dust amounts.



coding poc:

This proof of concept (PoC) is derived from `testMint`. Due to the use of floor rounding in LpModuleMock's calculations, both amount0 and amount1 compute to 0. However, if rounded up, they would compute to 1.

        assertEq(actualModule, address(module));

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Although `ArrakisMetaVaultPublic.mint` can be called by anyone, which is intentionally designed by the project team, it is recommended that only the router should be able to call it.
