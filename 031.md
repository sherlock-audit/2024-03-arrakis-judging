# ArrakisMetaVaultFactory can't deploy pools with non-string symbol ERC20 tokens

## Summary
When deploying new pools in the ArrakisMetaVaultFactory, the function `_getPublicVaultConstructorPayload()` in order to get the token name and symbol, which will be used the creation code of the new vault, this function proceeds to call the `getTokenName()` and `getTokenSymbol()` functions which query the `name()` and `symbol()` functions on the ERC20 contract. The problem is two-fold:
- It assumes that the symbol returned would be a string, but this is optional for ERC20 standard, there are tokens which return a bytes32 instead of a string.
- It's implemented in a try-catch block in which the "catch" is empty, which would mean that if the `symbol()` function fails, the catch block won't execute alternative logic leading to the failure of the vault deployment.

## Vulnerability Detail

Within the ERC20 standard, the symbol() is optional, as seen from [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20):

```solidity
symbol
Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. “HIX”.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.
```
As a frequent example of a differently implemented symbol function is the [MKR](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2#code) token.

As seen in the `_getPublicVaultConstructorPayload()` function, it expects a string to be returned when querying the symbol, and it implements an empty catch block:

```solidity

function _getPublicVaultConstructorPayload(
        address timeLock_,
        address token0_,
        address token1_
    ) internal view returns (bytes memory) {
        string memory name = "Arrakis Modular Vault";
        string memory symbol = "AMV";

        try this.getTokenName(token0_, token1_) returns (
            string memory result
        ) {
            name = result;
        } catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks

        try this.getTokenSymbol(token0_, token1_) returns (
            string memory result
        ) {
            symbol = result;
        } catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks

        return abi.encode(
            timeLock_,
            name,
            symbol,
            moduleRegistryPublic,
            manager,
            token0_,
            token1_
        );
    }

```
## Impact
The deployment of vaults for tokens which have a differently implemented symbol() function (i.e. doesn't return a string) will fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement some kind of a logic to be executed in the catch block in case the try fails.
