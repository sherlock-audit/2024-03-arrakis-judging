# ValantisModule::setALMAndManagerFees Public vault owner can use upgradeable oracle to rug funds

## Summary
The owner of a public vault can select any oracle in `ValantisModule::setALMAndManagerFees` (for example an upgradeable one).

If the oracle is controlled by the owner, they can rug the vault because `ArrakisStandardManager::rebalance` depends on `info.oracle.getPrice0()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the contest README, public vault owners are restricted: [README.md?plain=1#L33](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/64a7dc6ccb5de2824870474a9f35fd3386669e89/README.md?plain=1#L33)

A public vault owner can call `ValantisModule::setALMAndManagerFees` to “set HOT, oracle (wrapper of HOT), and init manager fees function.”: [ValantisHOTModule.sol#L188](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/64a7dc6ccb5de2824870474a9f35fd3386669e89/arrakis-modular/src/abstracts/ValantisHOTModule.sol#L188)

Therefore, a public vault owner can set any oracle of his choice, like an upgradeable one, which wouldn't arouse users' suspicions during the timelock imposed on the owner's actions, and later upgrade it to a malicious oracle to control the price returned by the oracle in `ArrakisStandardManager::rebalance`: [ArrakisStandardManager.sol#L354](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/64a7dc6ccb5de2824870474a9f35fd3386669e89/arrakis-modular/src/ArrakisStandardManager.sol#L354C48-L354C48).

## Impact

Theft of funds due to price oracle manipulation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The protocol owner should whitelist a list of verified oracles and allow the public vault owners to choose only from this list.
