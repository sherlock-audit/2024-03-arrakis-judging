# Missing Access Control in withdrawManagerBalance Function

## Summary
The `withdrawManagerBalance` function is intended to allow either the `metaVault` or the `manager` to withdraw manager fees. However, the function currently lacks an access control modifier, making it accessible to any external caller. This can lead to unauthorized withdrawals of manager fees, posing a significant security risk.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdrawManagerBalance` function does not have any access control mechanism in place, which means that any user can call this function. As a result, unauthorized entities can withdraw manager fees, compromising the security and integrity of the contract.
## Impact
The lack of access control on the `withdrawManagerBalance` function allows any external caller to withdraw manager fees, leading to potential financial loss and unauthorized access to funds. This could severely impact the contract's users and stakeholders, eroding trust and potentially causing significant financial damage.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, implement an access control modifier to ensure that only authorized entities (either the metaVault or the manager) can call the `withdrawManagerBalance` function. This can be done by adding a new modifier and applying it to the function. Use  `onlyManager`
