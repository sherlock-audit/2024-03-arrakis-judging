# Did not check whether the router is legal

## Summary

During swap action, the module will use a `call` instruction to invoke the target address to complete the swap, but it does not check if the router is compliant.

## Vulnerability Detail

`ValantisHOTModule.swap` does not check if the router involved in the swap is whitelisted. The executor can exploit this by setting the `router` to the `HOT` contract and calling `setAMMFees`, or by setting the router to the `SovereignPool` contract and calling functions that are restricted to `PoolManager` only.

The impact is significant; users can even attempt to change the `PoolManager` to themselves and then call `claimPoolManagerFees` to steal funds.

## Impact

The executor destroys the pool or steals the amount at will

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We should use a whitelist mechanism to restrict the addresses that can be used for swaps.
