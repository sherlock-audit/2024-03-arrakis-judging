# Modifying the `_managerFeePIPS` variable within the `ValantisHOTModule` is not possible until the `ValantisHOTModule` has been designated as the `poolManager` of the SovereignPool.

## Summary

Modifying the `_managerFeePIPS` variable within the `ValantisHOTModule` triggers the execution of the `SovereignPool::setPoolManagerFeeBips` function. However, this operation will fail as long as the `ValantisHOTModule` has not been designated as the `poolManager` of the `SovereignPool`, since the `SovereignPool::setPoolManagerFeeBips` function can only be called by the `poolManager`.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the `ValantisHOTModule::setManagerFeePIPS` function is invoked to modify the `_managerFeePIPS` value, it will trigger a call to the `SovereignPool::setPoolManagerFeeBips` function, even though the `alm` may not be set yet, as the `_oldFee` value is still present.

However, the `SovereignPool::setPoolManagerFeeBips` function is protected by the `onlyPoolManager` modifier. Therefore, if the `ValantisHOTModule` has not been designated as the `poolManager` of the `SovereignPool`, the transaction attempting to update the manager fee bips will fail.

```solidity
    function setManagerFeePIPS(uint256 newFeePIPS_)
        external
        whenNotPaused
    {
        uint256 _oldFee = _managerFeePIPS;

        // #region checks.

        if (msg.sender != metaVault.manager()) {
            revert OnlyManager(msg.sender, metaVault.manager());
        }

        if (newFeePIPS_ > PIPS) revert NewFeesGtPIPS(newFeePIPS_);

        // #endregion checks.

        _managerFeePIPS = newFeePIPS_;

289     if (address(alm) != address(0) || _oldFee != 0) {
290         pool.setPoolManagerFeeBips(newFeePIPS_ / 1e2);
        }

        emit LogSetManagerFeePIPS(_oldFee, newFeePIPS_);
    }
```

## Impact

Modifying the `poolManagerFeeBips` value of the `SovereignPool` is not possible until the `ValantisHOTModule` has been designated as the `poolManager` of the `SovereignPool`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `ValantisHOTModule::setManagerFeePIPS` function should be fixed as follows.

```diff
    function setManagerFeePIPS(uint256 newFeePIPS_)
        external
        whenNotPaused
    {
        uint256 _oldFee = _managerFeePIPS;

        // #region checks.

        if (msg.sender != metaVault.manager()) {
            revert OnlyManager(msg.sender, metaVault.manager());
        }

        if (newFeePIPS_ > PIPS) revert NewFeesGtPIPS(newFeePIPS_);

        // #endregion checks.

        _managerFeePIPS = newFeePIPS_;

-       if (address(alm) != address(0) || _oldFee != 0) {
+       if (address(alm) != address(0) && _oldFee != 0) {
            pool.setPoolManagerFeeBips(newFeePIPS_ / 1e2);
        }

        emit LogSetManagerFeePIPS(_oldFee, newFeePIPS_);
    }
```
