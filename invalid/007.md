# Missing `whenNotPaused` Modifier in `withdraw` Function

## Summary
The `withdraw `function in the contract is designed to allow the metaVault to withdraw tokens from the strategy. However, the function currently lacks the `whenNotPaused` modifier, making it callable even when the contract is paused. This can lead to operational issues and security risks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdraw` function does not include the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which means it can be executed even when the contract is paused. The absence of this modifier allows the function to perform critical operations like withdrawing liquidity and transferring tokens regardless of the contract’s paused state. This can lead to issues such as unauthorized withdrawals during maintenance or emergency situations.
## Impact
Operational Risk: Executing withdrawals when the contract is intended to be paused can disrupt planned maintenance or emergency responses.
Security Risk: Allows withdrawals during periods when the contract is paused for security reasons, potentially exposing the contract to further risks.
Inconsistent State: Operations performed during a paused state can lead to inconsistencies in the contract’s state and data.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to the `withdraw` function. This ensures that the function can only be called when the contract is not paused, aligning with the existing security measures and preventing operations during paused states.
