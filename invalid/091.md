# Initial depositor has to spend additional amount to mint MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY and it canot be withdrawn

## Summary
Initial depositor in `ArrakisMetaVaultPublic.sol` has to spend MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY to mint shares and this MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY is reduced from his shares. And this amount is not able to withdrawn by the depositor. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability lies in the `mint` function of `ArrakisMetaVaultPublic` contract

```solidity
    function mint(
        uint256 shares_,
        address receiver_
    ) external payable returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
        if (shares_ == 0) revert MintZero();
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();

@>      uint256 proportion = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            shares_, BASE, supply > 0 ? supply : 1 ether
        );

        if (receiver_ == address(0)) revert AddressZero("Receiver");

        if (supply == 0) {
            _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY);
            shares_ = shares_ - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
        }

        _mint(receiver_, shares_);

        (amount0, amount1) = _deposit(proportion);

        emit LogMint(shares_, receiver_, amount0, amount1);
    }
```

Here in the above code you can see the proportion is calculated wrongly before minting the MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY. At the time of deposting the propotion the `totalSupply` will be the MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY. So the prpotion should be calculated after minting the MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY.  

And the minting of MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY is added in account of the initial depositor which is wrong mechanism this adds liabilities to the first depositor and propotion is calculated with 1 ether, which make the propostion too small if we comparing the propostion with the second depositor who minting the same shares.
 
## Impact
The initial depositor has to spend additional amount to mint the MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY and its not possible to withdrawn this. And the prpotion is too small comparing to the futual deposits.

## Recommendation

Update the code like the below snippet.

```diff
    function mint(
        uint256 shares_,
        address receiver_
    ) external payable returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
        if (shares_ == 0) revert MintZero();
-       uint256 supply = totalSupply();

-       uint256 proportion = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            shares_,
            BASE,
            supply > 0 ? supply : 1 ether
        );

        if (receiver_ == address(0)) revert AddressZero("Receiver");

        if (supply == 0) {
            _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY);
-           shares_ = shares_ - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
        }
+       uint256 supply = totalSupply();

+       uint256 proportion = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            shares_,
            BASE,
            supply
        );

        _mint(receiver_, shares_);

        (amount0, amount1) = _deposit(proportion);

        emit LogMint(shares_, receiver_, amount0, amount1);
    }
```
