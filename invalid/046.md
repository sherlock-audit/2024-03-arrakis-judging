# Missing Initialization of Parent Contracts in `ValantisModule`

## Summary
The `ValantisModule` contract in `ValantisHOTModule.sol` inherits from several other contracts, including `IArrakisLPModule`, `IValantisHOTModule`, `PausableUpgradeable`, and `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`. During the security review, it was identified that the `initialize` function does not include calls to initialize the parent contracts `PausableUpgradeable` and `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `initialize` function does not call the initialization functions for the inherited `PausableUpgradeable` and `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` contracts. These functions are crucial for setting up internal state variables and ensuring the proper functionality of pausing mechanisms and reentrancy guards.
## Impact
* Reentrancy Attacks: Without the initialization of `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`, the contract remains vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, which can result in significant financial losses and unauthorized fund withdrawals.

* Ineffective Pausing Mechanism: If `PausableUpgradeable` is not initialized, the pause functionality may not work correctly. This prevents the contract from being paused during emergencies, leaving it exposed to ongoing attacks or operational issues.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add  `__ReentrancyGuard_init();` and   `__Pausable_init();` in `initialize` function.
