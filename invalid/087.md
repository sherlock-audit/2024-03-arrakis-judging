# Users lost their private vault

## Summary
In ArrakisMetaVaultFactory.sol, there is a function name `deployPrivateVault` for user to create their private vault, however attacker make users can't track their private vault
## Vulnerability Detail
Function is `deployPrivateVault ` using create3 with parameter `vault = Create3.create3(salt, creationCode)`. The vault address will be determined by the **salt** value and the **creationCode**. Salt value will be calculated by: `bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encode(msg.sender, salt_))`. Both msg.sender and salt_ can be observed by an attacker when TX is mined. The creationCode is calculated like this:
```solidity
bytes memory creationCode = abi.encodePacked(
            ICreationCode(creationCodePrivateVault).getCreationCode(),
            abi.encode(
                moduleRegistryPrivate,
                manager,
                token0_,
                token1_,
                address(nft)
            )
        );
```
Attacker can have all initialize parameter's value here (public variable and from TX), can get `Initialization Code` of private vault by calling `getCreationCode` in `arrakis-modular\src\CreationCodePrivateVault.sol`. With all that information, an attacker can frontrun the creation TX with their own creation request (can use `create2` opcode directly), with the same parameters. When the victim's transaction would be executed, the address is non-empty so the EVM would reject its creation. This would result in a bad UX for a user, cause they saw that the creation was not success. The result vault would still be usable, but would be hard to track as it was created in another TX.
## Impact
As mention above, bad UX for user, and it hard for user to track their private vault. Furthermore, the NFT can't be mined for user, the result vault would not be added to `_privateVaults` array. Can consider it like a DOS attack.
**Likelihood**: not easy but possible
**Impact**: medium
So I think this will be a medium issue

        // #endregion compute salt = salt + msg.sender.


        // #region get the creation code for TokenMetaVault.


        bytes memory creationCode = abi.encodePacked(
            ICreationCode(creationCodePrivateVault).getCreationCode(),
            abi.encode(
                moduleRegistryPrivate,
                manager,
                token0_,
                token1_,
                address(nft)
            )
        );


        // #endregion get the creation code for TokenMetaVault.


        vault = Create3.create3(salt, creationCode);
        nft.mint(owner_, uint256(uint160(vault)));

## Recommendation
Use an private ever-increasing nonce counter to guarantee unique contract addresses.
