# Contracts are vulnerable to fee-on-transfer accounting-related issues

## Summary
The `deposit `function is designed to allow deposits into the strategy by transferring tokens from a depositor. However, the function currently does not verify the token balances before and after the transfer. This can lead to potential issues where the actual amount transferred is different from the expected amount, causing discrepancies in the accounting and potential security vulnerabilities.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function does not verify the balances of `token0` and `token1` before and after the `safeTransferFrom` calls. This verification is crucial to ensure that the exact amount of tokens expected to be transferred are indeed transferred. Without this verification, there could be discrepancies due to issues such as insufficient allowance, incorrect balances, or other unforeseen errors.
## Impact
Incorrect Accounting: Discrepancies in the actual amount of tokens transferred versus the expected amount.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To ensure that the correct amount of tokens are transferred, add checks to verify the balances before and after the `safeTransferFrom` calls. This will help to detect any discrepancies immediately and ensure that the function operates as expected.
