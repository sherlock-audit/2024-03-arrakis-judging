# Cooldown Period Management in _updateParamsChecks Function

## Summary
The _updateParamsChecks function within the smart contract includes a check to ensure that a cooldown period is set. However, there are concerns regarding how the cooldown period is reset.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function currently does not include a mechanism to reset the cooldown period once it has finished. This omission could prevent subsequent updates from occurring as intended.

## Impact
Without a mechanism to reset the cooldown period, the contract might enter a state where no further updates can be made, effectively halting operations that depend on timely updates.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure there is a mechanism within the contract to reset the cooldown period after it has finished. This could involve updating the lastrebalanceupdate at the appropriate times to reflect the most recent valid rebalance operation.
