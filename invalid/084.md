# Missing Check for Manager Fee Limit in _updateParamsChecks Function

## Summary
The _updateParamsChecks function within the smart contract is responsible for validating various parameters during setup. However, it currently lacks a check to ensure that the manager fee does not exceed the maximum allowable limit of 50%.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function does not validate the managerFee parameter to ensure it is within the acceptable range. Without this check, there is a risk that the managerFee could be set to an excessively high value, potentially leading to unintended high costs for users and operational risks for the platform.

## Impact
- Excessive Fees: Without a cap on the manager fee, it could be set higher than the intended maximum of 50%, leading to excessive fees that could deter users and reduce trust in the platform.
