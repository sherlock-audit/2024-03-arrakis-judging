# The executor can prevent the manager from receiving the manager fee.

## Summary

When the vault creates a new module, its `_managerFeePIPS` value will be 0. The executor can exploit this to prevent the manager from receiving the fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

The executor can call `ArrakisStandardManager.setModule` to set a new module. When the manager calls `setManagerFeePIPS` to set the managerFeePIPS of a private vault, the private vault owner can create a new module and then use the executor to call `setModule`. As a result, the managerFeePIPS of the private vault will become 0. These actions will not affect `ArrakisStandardManager.vaultInfo`, so the manager will still believe that the managerFeePIPS of the private vault has not changed. Ultimately, when the manager calls `withdrawManagerBalance` to withdraw the manager fee, the amount available to withdraw will be 0.

Consider the following scenario:

1. Alice is the owner and executor of a private vault. The manager wants to collect the manager fee from Alice's private vault, so they set the managerFeePIPS to 1000.
2. Alice realizes she will be charged a manager fee. After the manager calls `finalizeIncreaseManagerFeePIPS`, Alice immediately calls `whitelistModules` and `setModule` to set a new module. At this point, the new module's `_managerFeePIPS` value will be 0.
3. Alice then calls `setALMAndManagerFees` (this function internally calls `pool.setPoolManagerFeeBips(_managerFeePIPS / 1e2)`), ensuring that the `poolManagerFeeBips` value in the pool remains 0.
4. When the manager queries vaultInfo to check Alice's private vault, they see that the managerFeePIPS is still 1000 and believe the setting was successful. Ultimately, this prevents the manager from receiving the intended manager fee.

## Impact

Manager cannot receive manager fee

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to call `IArrakisLPModule(IArrakisMetaVault(vault_).module()).setManagerFeePIPS(vaultInfo[vault_].managerFeePIPS);` in the `ArrakisStandardManager.setModule` function.
