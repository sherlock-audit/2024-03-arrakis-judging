# Oracle doesn't check if Arbitrum Sequencer is active

## Summary
Arrakis is going to deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Gnosis, so when using Chainlink on Arbitrum requires to check if the sequencer is down.

The bug could be leveraged by malicious actors to take advantage of the sequencer downtime.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a lack of a check if the L2 Arbitrum sequencer is down in `valantis-hot/src/HOTOracle.sol`.
```solidity
  function _getOraclePriceUSD(
        AggregatorV3Interface feed,
        uint32 maxOracleUpdateDuration
    ) internal view returns (uint256 oraclePriceUSD) {
        (, int256 oraclePriceUSDInt, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = feed.latestRoundData();

        if (block.timestamp - updatedAt > maxOracleUpdateDuration) {
            revert HOTOracle___getOraclePriceUSD_stalePrice();
        }

        oraclePriceUSD = oraclePriceUSDInt.toUint256();
    }
```

## Impact
could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
