# Loss of funds caused by edge case in Deposit & Withdraw functions of Private & Public Vaults

## Summary
Edge case found in the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions of `Private` & `Public` vaults leads to loss of funds for the Users .  

## Vulnerability Detail
Arrakis Meta Vault is composed of two types of Vaults : One type is Public & the other is Private . 
The Public ones have slippage controls set up in Router while adding & removing Liquidity as shown below : 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/main/arrakis-modular/src/ArrakisPublicVaultRouter.sol#L145C9-L151C10

```solidity
 if (
            amount0 < params_.amount0Min
                || amount1 < params_.amount1Min
                || sharesReceived < params_.amountSharesMin
        ) {
            revert BelowMinAmounts();
        }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/main/arrakis-modular/src/ArrakisPublicVaultRouter.sol#L1032C8-L1037C10

```solidity
 if (
            amount0 < params_.amount0Min
                || amount1 < params_.amount1Min
        ) {
            revert ReceivedBelowMinimum();
        }
```

but the same is not implemented in deposit & withdraw of Private Vaults . Now let's see how it causes problem in those functions . 
Firstly let's look at deposit functionality of Private Vaults . Here the contract flow is as follows : 
`ArrakisMetaVaultPrivate.sol#deposit` -> `ArrakisMetaVaultPrivate.sol#_deposit` -> `ValantisHOTModulePrivate.sol#fund` -> `HOT#depositLiquidity` 
The `HOT#depositLiquidity` function has a check `checkPriceDeviation`. It compares the spot price with oracle price and the deviation between those is compared with a fixed max deviation allowed by `HOT` . 
Let's take an example , where price of token0/token1 in real time is `X` . The oracle used here is Chainlink , which has usual deviation of about ~1-3% from it's original value . Let's say the oracle price has a deviation of 2% to the upper side , i.e., price reported by Oracle is `1.02X` & the spot price was manipulated by a Malicious user to cause a deviation of 5% to upper side i.e., spot price reported is `1.05X` . 
The max deviation set by Protocol in deploy script is 5% as shown below :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/main/valantis-hot/scripts/deploy/02_HOTDeploy.s.sol#L83C1-L84C54

```solidity
            // Set HOT Parameters
            hot.setMaxOracleDeviationBips(500); // 5%
```

If the max deviation is set to 5% , the given above condition will have a deviation of 3% upper side & will bypass the `checkPriceDeviation` condition in `HOT#depositLiquidity` . In this case the amount of tokens deposited by the Victim User would be recorded as 5% less than what he should have deposited .

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-arrakis/blob/main/valantis-hot/src/libraries/HOTParams.sol#L183C5-L196C6

```solidity
    function checkPriceDeviation(
        uint256 sqrtPriceAX96,
        uint256 sqrtPriceBX96,
        uint256 maxDeviationInBipsLower,
        uint256 maxDeviationInBipsUpper
    ) internal pure returns (bool) {
        uint256 diff = sqrtPriceAX96 > sqrtPriceBX96 ? sqrtPriceAX96 - sqrtPriceBX96 : sqrtPriceBX96 - sqrtPriceAX96;
        uint256 maxDeviationInBips = sqrtPriceAX96 < sqrtPriceBX96 ? maxDeviationInBipsLower : maxDeviationInBipsUpper;

        if (diff * HOTConstants.BIPS > maxDeviationInBips * sqrtPriceBX96) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
```

Similarly while withdrawing in Private Vaults , if the spot is Manipulated  to 5% down side & the oracle price is also showing a deviation of 2% from the original price downwards , then the withdrawed amount by Victim User will be 5% less than what it should actually be withdrawing . 
For example - If the Victim User was trying to withdraw 1000e6 of USDC & 0.5e18 of WETH from a USDC/WETH Pool , then considering above condition he would be receiving 950e6 of USDC & 0.475e18 of WETH , causing loss of funds for the User . 

And there is a 3rd case ,this time let's consider the case of Public Vaults. Let's say the Oracle price has deviation of 3% upwards & The spot price is manipulated to 5% upwards . Now when a User tries to withdraw 1000e6 USDC & 0.5e18 of WETH , he will receive 1050e6 USDC & 0.525e18 of Weth ,causing losses to protocol & stealing other User's funds in a Public Vault . 

All these are caused due to the way the deviation checks are done( i.e., by taking difference between Oracle price & Spot price) & due to the fact that no upper or lower limits can be set by the User to prevent these . 

## Impact
-> Unintended Loss of funds for the User in Private Vaults .
-> Unintended Profits given to User in Public Vaults .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-> Add slippage controls to deposit & withdraw functions of `ArrakisMetaVaultPrivate.sol` .
-> Add a check in removing liquidity functions to check whether the withdrawed amount is greater than the requested amount or not .
